# React Calculator
It's a simple calculator for doing basic arithmetic operations based on React, TailwindCSS and Shunting Yard Algorithm.
Basic Arithmetic operation can be easily done with `eval()` but as per `MDN` it's avoided due to security reason, there are other ways to use `eval` function [MDN Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!).
I choose Shunting Yard algorithm because it can be flexible and more maintainable in future for different scenarios and functionalities.

# Stack/Libraries
- Create React App (Boilerplate)
- React
- TailwindCSS
- React Toastify
